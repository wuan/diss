@article{Kon00,
	Abstract = {Low-frequency transport properties of the Wigner solid on normal and superfluid 3He have been studied. It is known that the Wigner solid deforms the free surface of liquid He to form a dimple lattice. The low-frequency resistivity is successfully interpreted by the ballistic and specular scattering of 3He quasiparticles from the dimple lattice. The resistivity decreases abruptly below the superfluid transition temperature. For superfluid 3He-A, the l-texture, presumably perpendicularly oriented to the free surface, has an essential influence on the resistivity.},

	Abstract = {The wave functions and energy levels associated with a finite one-dimensional periodic potential field are investigated. In a plot of the energy spectrum versus interatomic distance the surface levels appears only at lattice constants so small that the boundary curves for the allowed energy bands have crossed. The levels appear in the "forbidden" region between allowed bands in pairs one coming from each of the adjoining bands. In three dimensions these surface levels give rise to surface bands. The surface bands probably exist and are half filled for diamond. The exist for all metals and are entirely unoccupied only for the monovalent metals.},

The mobility is found to be smaller than on the bare H$_2$ or on the bulk He surfaces. The extra electron scattering is due to the He gas atoms, the ripplons, and the density fluctuations in the uppermost He monolayer. The scattering from the density fluctuations is a direct measure of $K_2$, the two-dimensional compressibility of the He monolayer.},

	Abstract = {We report preliminary results of a cyclotron resonance study of surface electrons (SE) on saturated helium films covering a PMMA substrate at T > 1 K. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric response epsilon(k, omega) of the SE are measured at fixed k and omega in B-fields up to 10 T in a 12 GHz cavity. The cyclotron resonance of the SE is determined at different helium film thicknesses d(He) and at various electron densities. At small d(He) we find significant anomalies in the cyclotron resonance lineshape and position. As d(He) increases the lineshape becomes progressively more symmetric and its peak moves towards the cyclotron field value expected for a free electron. To fit these data we have modified the classical Drude expression, introducing two different relaxation times for the low and high B-field regions. The phenomenological formulas fit the data quite well. A systematic theoretical analysis of these results is in progress.},

	Abstract = {The reasons why supersaturated states appear for a 2D electron system on a liquid-helium surface and the possibility of stationary existence of such states are discussed. The main characteristics of a 2D electron system on helium under stationary conditions are calculated. It is shown that the well-known saturation state for electrons above helium is one of a continuum of supersaturated states. The experimental possibilities for observing and identifying supersaturated states for electrons on helium surface are noted.},

@article{Mon02,
	Abstract = {In this article we review recent progress in understanding of many-electron effects on the quantum magnetotransport in two-dimensional Coulomb liquids in which the interaction potential energy per electron can be approximately a hundred times larger than the mean kinetic energy. The conventional Fermi-liquid approach based on the introduction of weakly interacting excitations being not applicable, it is remarkable that a quatitative theoretical description of the equilibrium and transport properties of the 2D Coulomb liquid appears to be possible. An account of basic properties of the strongly interacting 2D electron system under magnetic field realized on a free surface of liquid helium is given. Due to the high magnetic field applied perpendicular to the system, the electron liquid constituted of strongly interacting electrons ca be described as a collection of statistically independent electrons, each of the having the discrete Landau spectrum in a local reference frame moving ultra-fast with regard to the center of mass frame of the entire electron liquid. We found it surprising that the narrowing of Landau levels induced by Coulomb forces in local frames is accompanied by a strong Coulomb broadening of the electron dynamical structure factor (DSF) in the laboratory reference frame. We discuss in detail the magnetotransport theories in two dimensions, especially the force-balance equation method and the memory function formalism which allow to reduce the electron transport problem to the description of the equilibrium electron DSF. We show that the whole body of the DC magnetoconductivity and cyclotron resonance absorption data measured and reported within the last two decades (even previously conflicting with theory) can be very well described by means of a simple model for the electron DSF entering the imaginary part of the memory function or the effective collision frequency of the electrons},
